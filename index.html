<p> At Ease is a Property Management and Tenant application that aims to take the work out of renting. </p>




<h2>
<a id="Goals" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goals</h2>

<p> The overall goal of At Ease is to comfort both tenants and managers throughout the rental process. This is reached by providing them with an environment in which all of their needs pertaining to renting a property are handled in one intuitive and easy-to-use application. We want our app to be easy to maneuver and work at a high level. </p>

<h3>
<a id="Motivation" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p> The motivation for this project comes from the problems presented by renting a property from an Independent Rental Owner(IRO). Today, tenants face many unwanted problems that all mostly stem from poor communication between tenants and their property manager. Our app, At Ease, seeks to remedy these problems by attacking their root, and creating an environment where tenants can be at ease about the place they live. </p>
